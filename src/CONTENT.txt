homework  -- first work as homework.
usc.3.1.0 -- track split into NUMBER_OF_TIME_SLICES pieces, converted into 2D data, augmented, fed to 11 level CNN
usc.3.2.0 -- track split into NUMBER_OF_TIME_SLICES pieces, converted into 2D data, augmented, fed to 11 level CNN (differ by params)
usc.3.3.0 -- track split into NUMBER_OF_TIME_SLICES pieces, converted into 2D data, augmented, fed to 11 level CNN (differ by params)
usc.3.4.0 -- track directly fed into CNN-34 with residuals + 2 layer fc
usc.3.5.0 -- track directly fed into CNN-34 with residuals + 6 layer fc
usc.4.0.1 -- dont know if it is even working.
usc.4.0.2 -- track split into NUMBER_OF_TIME_SILCES pieces, directly fed into  NUMBER_OF_TIME_SILCES x CNN-11 (each piece fed into its own CNN-11), all the CNN-11 results are fed into LSTM as time frames,  
usc.5.0.0 -- track split into NUMBER_OF_TIME_SILCES pieces, directly fed into LSTM as time frames
